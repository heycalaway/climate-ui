**Climate UI** is a user interface theme for [Climate Syntax](https://github.com/jmcalaway/climate-syntax) designed intuitively to make Atom feel more intelligent and complimentary to your workflow. With features such as *File Themes* and a true *Distraction-Free Mode*, **Climate UI** makes development stand out where it needs to and blend when distracting. There's a tipping scale when it comes to text editors that begs to find a balance between being attractive and being useful. Here's a bit of both.

Thank you for taking interest in the Climate Atom Theme. The development of this theme was born of a passion project but also the short, stolen moments I've had between being a loving husband, preparing to be a father and growing as an enthusiastic, nerdy developer. For those who know me, I like to provide my passions with undivided attention, but since that ideology is near impossible to satisfy, my passion projects often get the hours between late and extremely late. If you're happy and enthusiastic about this theme, and you're looking for an avenue to show your support beyond a star, you're welcome to buy me a cup of coffee, if only to keep me up and working! Thank you, everyone!
