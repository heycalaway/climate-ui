A user interface theme for [Climate Syntax](https://github.com/jmcalaway/climate-syntax), designed to make developing in Atom both productive and alluring. *Climate UI* adapts aesthetically based on the active file's language. Program your CSS in sky blue, your JavaScript in summer green, the list goes on and you can customize it all. Enable the popular "Distraction-Free Mode", and see in Tree View only the files you have open (say goodbye to the interruption of long, intimidating folder structures not in use!).

# Installation
---
With the terminal open, key the following:

```shell
apm install climate-ui
```

Thank you for taking interest in the Climate Atom Theme. The development of this theme was born of a passion project but also the short, stolen moments I've had between being a loving husband, preparing to be a father and growing as an enthusiastic, nerdy developer. For those who know me, I like to provide my passions with undivided attention, but since that ideology is near impossible to satisfy, my passion projects often get the hours between late and extremely late. If you're happy and enthusiastic about this theme, and you're looking for an avenue to show your support beyond a star, you're welcome to buy me a cup of coffee, if only to keep me up and working! Thank you, everyone!
