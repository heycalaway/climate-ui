A user interface theme for [Climate Syntax](https://github.com/jmcalaway/climate-syntax), designed to make developing in Atom both productive and alluring. *Climate UI* adapts aesthetically based on the active file's language. Program your CSS in sky blue, your JavaScript in summer green, the list goes on and you can customize it all. Enable the popular "Distraction-Free Mode", and see in Tree View only the files you have open (say goodbye to the interruption of long, intimidating folder structures not in use!).

# Installation
With the terminal open, key the following:

```shell
apm install climate-ui
```
